                        <p className='font-medium'>
                        Hello, I'm  Adriana, a dedicated Computer Science student at Portland State University with a strong 
                        passion for software engineering and problem-solving. I am set to graduate in June 2024 with a Bachelor of Science 
                        degree in Computer Science.

                        </p>
                            
                        <p className='my-4 font-medium'>
                        My skills encompass a wide range of programming languages and tools, including C++, C, Python, Rust, and more. 
                        I'm comfortable with data structures and problem-solving. My experience as a Software Engineer Intern in Portland 
                        allowed me to work within a SCRUM agile team, collaborating with my team to improve existing tools and migrate 
                        databases to AWS successfully. I contributed to streamlining development processes, maintained and enhanced 
                        existing tools, and played a role in the successful migration of databases to AWS.


                        </p>

                        <p className='my-4 font-medium'>
                        My commitment to excellence is also reflected in my past 
                        experiences, including completing the Lâ€™SPACE Mission Concept Academy, where I received training from NASA scientists 
                        and engineers.
                        </p>

                        <p className='font-medium'>
                        In addition to my academic and professional endeavors, I am an enthusiastic participant in coding challenges and hackathons, 
                        such as the Nike Insidious Hackathon and the UDEMY 100 days of Python Code Challenge. I am excited to bring my technical expertise,
                        problem-solving skills, and passion for software development to contribute meaningfully to your team.

                        </p>
